# MARS-RFD
Rerquires geological data. Geodata used is: thickness of Mesozoic and Quaternary sediments (mezo, hght). Besides that, doserate 1m above surface (dose) and radium in soil (ra). RFD is presented as rfdk (diffusive radon - kriging estimate), rfdd (diffusive radon - real measurements) and rfd (all radon measurements, including anomalies)
Categorical data such as types of quaternary and mesozoic sediments are not included, as MARS algorithm doesn't work with categorical data.
